# review paper and code overview
The code for this paper, 'An Overview and Exploration of Web-Based General Phonetic Generation Tasks,' is a compilation used for splitting data in the dataset section, extracting audio, and frame extraction.By making this code publicly available, we hope that future researchers in the field of phonetic generation can make better use of the dataset we have curated and conduct more in-depth research on phonetic generation tasks.
# introduction
The following code includes three aspects of code: firstly, the use of YouTube-dl for downloading YouTube videos, some of which are comprised of this type of video; secondly, the code for extracting audio tracks and processing video frame sequences; and lastly, the code for randomly splitting the dataset into training, testing, and validation sets.
